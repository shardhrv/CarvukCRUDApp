# Carvuk Technical Assessment
## Overview
For the Technical Assessment, I have built the following app with **Vite + React + TypeScript** for the frontend, and **Supabase** on the backend. 
There is currently a running demo of the application deployed with **Vercel** at: [CRUDvuk](https://crudvuk-app.vercel.app/)

Users can:
- Sign up / log in (email + GitHub OAuth)  
- Browse a paginated list of car services  
- Book a service (auto‑assigning an available driver)  
- View, paginate, and cancel bookings  
- Auto‑complete past bookings  
- Edit user profile (name & email)

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite, React, TypeScript, React Router, React‑Query  
- **Styling**: Tailwind‑inspired utility classes  
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS)  
- **Deployment**: Vercel
